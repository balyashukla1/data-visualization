# Analyzing CMPD Traffic Stops

For this problem set, we'll examine a data set of stops by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD). 

Our focus will be to understand what factors are related to whether someone is searched or not for a traffic stop.

For our data set, you'll load the csv file we saved in the setup. This should be in your data folder.

```{r load-packages-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(ggspatial) # make sure to install if you don't have it

df <- read_csv("./data/Officer_Traffic_Stops.csv")
```

## Demographics of drivers (1 point)

First, look at the data using the `glimpse()` function from `dplyr`

```{r glimpse}
glimpse(df)
```

Notice the different variable types: character (chr), num (numeric), and datetime (POSIXct).

Let's consider our target variable: `Was_a_Search_Conducted`.

**Plot** a bar chart that counts the number of records by `Was_a_Search_Conducted`.

```{r bar}
ggplot(data= df, aes(x= Was_a_Search_Conducted))+
    geom_bar()
```

**It's okay if students use `geom_col()` instead of `geom_bar()`**

How well balanced is the data set by this field? The count for "No" is over 60000 while the count for "Yes" is way below 5000. The data se is not well balances by "Was_a_Search_Conducted" field because instances where no search was conducted is way higher compared to instances where a search was conducted. 

Next, let's consider the age range of the driver. 

**Plot** a histogram of `Driver_Age`. Determine an appropriate number of bins.

```{r histogram}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x= Driver_Age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = 'red')
```

Once you go above (around) 40-50 bins, you'll notice some points stick out. 

What is happening? Majority of points lie under 60 and over 20 and this is because driver's license is issued 14-17 and the average life expectancy in Charlotte, NC is 79-82. This explains why two bars stick out once the binwidth is changed to over 40-50 bins. 

**Plot** a density plot of `Driver_Age`. Add in a fill to be "lightblue". Determine an appropriate kernel density to use (`adjust`).

```{r density}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x= Driver_Age)) +
  geom_density(fill = 'lightblue', kernel = 'gaussian')
```

**Plot** a box plot with `Was_a_Search_Conducted` on the x-axis and `Driver_Age` on the y-axis.

```{r boxplot}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = Was_a_Search_Conducted, y = Driver_Age)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

**Plot** a violin plot.

```{r violin}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = Was_a_Search_Conducted, y = Driver_Age)) + 
  geom_violin()
```

From the plots above, do you think the age of the driver is a significant factor in whether a search was conducted? Why or why not? I do not beliebe age of the driver is a significant factor in whether a search was conducted because the median age for both "Yes" and "No" is around 30. The IQR for "No" is ~23 and the IQR for "Yes" is ~15. The area of the violin graph for "Yes" is larger for under 30 years old. 

## Date of stop (1 point)

Let's plot the number of stops by time. 

Recalling part one, the `Month_of_Stop` variable is a character, not a date variable. The datatime's are simply when the data was collected; not when the stop occurred. Therefore, we'll need to convert the `Month_of_Stop` variable from a character to a Date format.

Let's first cleanup the date field using `tidyverse` packages like `stringr` and `lubridate`.
```{r date-cleanup}
library(stringr); library(lubridate)

df <- df %>%
  mutate(Month_of_Stop = str_replace_all(Month_of_Stop, "/","-")) %>% # replace "/" with "-"
  mutate(Month_of_Stop = paste0(df$Month_of_Stop,"-01")) %>% # add in day
  mutate(Date = ymd(Month_of_Stop)) # created a date field
```

**Plot** a line chart with the number of traffic stops for each month (hint: start with the `count()` function by Date then feed into ggplot. Remember the count variable is named 'n'.).

```{r stops}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
count_by_month <- df %>%
  group_by(Date) %>%
  count()
  

ggplot(data = count_by_month, aes(x = Date, y = n)) + 
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(labels = date_format("%m-%Y"))
```

What is the trend (i.e., long term rate of change) of the number of traffic stops in Charlotte? The long term rate of change in the number of traffic stops in Charlotte has been constant with an average of about 2700 stops. 

**Plot** the same plot but add in `facet_wrap()` by the `Reason_for_Stop` variable.

```{r stops-by-reason}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
count_by_reason <- df %>%
  group_by(Date, Reason_for_Stop) %>%
  count()
  
ggplot(data = count_by_reason, aes(x = Date, y = n)) + 
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(labels = date_format("%m-%Y")) +
  facet_wrap(~Reason_for_Stop)
```

What is a problem with this plot? For some categories the number of stops are low, and it is impossible to deduce a trend for these categories. Also, x-axis is too compact, which reduces the readability. 

To address this problem, you will need to figure out how to adjust the scale. To do this, you need to use R's documentation to see whether there is a parameter in `facet_wrap`.

Go to your RStudio console and type `?facet_wrap`.

What parameter allows you to modify the scales of `facet_wrap`? scales parameter allows the modification of scales. 

**Plot** the same plot but with a free y-axis scale.

```{r stops-by-reason-2}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
count_by_reason <- df %>%
  group_by(Date, Reason_for_Stop) %>%
  count()
  
ggplot(data = count_by_reason, aes(x = Date, y = n)) + 
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(labels = date_format("%m-%Y")) +
  facet_wrap(~Reason_for_Stop, scales = "free")
```

Which type of police stop has had the most volatility (i.e., big swings in number of stops)? Speeding has had the most volatility. 

What is one problem with allowing the y-axis be free? Allowing the y-axis be free, it makes the y-axis vary between each subplot. This variation makes the comparison misleading.  

Small multiples tends to be less effective when each of the variables are on different scales or magnitudes.

Let's consider instead CMPD traffic stops but by CMPD division. These are more even spread by division than the type of stop.

**Plot** a line chart (optional points too) for stops by `Date` (x axis) and counts ('n', or whatever you named your count variable) (y axis). (hint: to modify how the date is shown, use the layer `scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y") +` to show only the year. Feel free to modify by looking at `?scale_x_date`.)

```{r stops-by-division}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
count_by_division <- df %>%
  group_by(Date, CMPD_Division) %>%
  count()
  
ggplot(data = count_by_division, aes(x = Date, y = n)) + 
  geom_line() + geom_point() +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y") +
  facet_wrap(~CMPD_Division) #, scales = "free")
```

What are three observations you can make about the number of police stops by divison? (hint: just write about what's in the data.)

1. Freedom Division and Metro Division have the fewest police stops on average. 

2. Early in 2017, there was a hike in police stops in North Tryon Division and remained over 300 on average.  

3. South Division and Providence Division have the highest police stops on average. 

Next, this doesn't help tell us where these areas are. For that, let's use a shape file to create a chloropleth of stops by division.

## Geography (1 point)

For this example, we'll create a cholorpleth for the number of police stops by police division.

To do this, we need to use the `sf` package. (For help along the way, see [this tutorial](http://strimas.com/r/tidy-sf/) on `sf` package.)

```{r load-sf}
library(sf); library(viridis)

cmpd <- st_read("./data/CMPD_Police_Divisions/CMPD_Police_Divisions.shp")
```

Note that while we have five files, we only load in the shapefile (`.shp`) file. This is typical but know that to use this file you would need the other four files in the same folder as your shapefile.

**Plot** cmpd using the `geom_sf` package where you provide `fill = DNAME` as the only aesthetic. Add in a title saying "CMPD Divisions" and add the `theme_bw()` theme to make translate the file into the black and white template.

```{r geom_sf}
ggplot(cmpd) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill=DNAME)) +
  ggtitle("CMPD Divisions") +
  theme_bw()
```

One problem with this map is it's hard to read the division names. That is, it may be better to remove the legend and put the labels of each division within the plot.

To do this, we can use the related `geom_sf_label()` geom, using the name of the division as the aesthetic label.

**Plot** the same plot from above but with the name of the division as the label. 
```{r geom_sf_no_legend}
ggplot(cmpd) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill=DNAME), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_sf_label(aes(label = DNAME), size = 1) +
  ggtitle("CMPD Divisions") +
  theme_bw()
```

1. You'll likely need to reduce the size of the label, using the `size` paramater. You should likely set the `size` to under 2. 

2. Make sure to remove the legend (it's redundant and no longer necessary).

3. Create a new variable named `Name` that removes the term " Division". This term is redundant and takes up a lot of space in the labels from `DNAME`. To do this step, use this snippet of code at the top of your pipeline:

```{r eval=F}
cmpd %>%
  mutate(Name = as.character(DNAME)) %>%
  mutate(Name = str_replace_all(Name, " Division","")) 
```


4. Save it as an object named `g`. Make sure to call it once so that the map will output.

```{r geom-labels}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
g <- cmpd %>%
  mutate(Name = as.character(DNAME)) %>%
  mutate(Name = str_replace_all(Name, " Division","")) %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill=Name), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_sf_label(aes(label = Name), size = 1) +
  ggtitle("CMPD Divisions") +
  theme_bw()

g
```

**Plot**: Now let's change the projection type. Simply add in `coord_sf(crs = st_crs(102003))` as an additional layer to `g`.

```{r albers}
library(sf)
g + coord_sf(crs = st_crs(102003))
```


Do you notice any difference between the two maps? Yes, there is a difference in the allignment of the longitude and latitude. 

## Advanced Plot: (0.5 point)

Now, let's create a chloropleth. Below is the code to create an advanced plot.

In this problem, you need to explain what each step below is doing:

- `mutate()`: The mutate step creates a new variable called CMPD_Division. And as.character is to coerce its argument (DNAME) to character type. 
- `inner_join()`: The inner_join step is to join tables together by CMPD_Division
- `mutate()`: This mututate step creates a new variable called year.
- `geom_sf()`: This step creates map with count as the fill. 
- `scale_fill_viridis()`: This step uses the viridis color scale and uses scales::comma as the labels.
- `labs()`:This step is to add the title and the caption
- `annotation_scale()`: This step is to determine the overall scale of annotation object. 
- `facet_wrap()`: Divides the display of map by years. 
- `theme_bw()`: Theme_bw() is used to change the background to white. 
- `theme()`: (what are each of the options doing in `theme()`?) theme is used to customize the non-data components of the plot. plot.title is used to change the text font to bold and size to 1.5 using element_text. axis.text specifies all axis tick labels (axis.text) and element_blank sets it to blank. Next line in code specifies tick marks along axes to be blank. 
- `ggsave()`: This step saves the plot as a pdf and png file. 

```{r adv-plot}
library(sf)
library(viridisLite)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggspatial)
cmpd_chloropleth <- cmpd %>% 
  mutate(CMPD_Division = as.character(DNAME)) %>% 
  inner_join(count(df, CMPD_Division, Date), by = "CMPD_Division") %>%
  mutate(Year = lubridate::year(Date)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = n)) +
  scale_fill_viridis("Traffic Stops", labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "CMPD Traffic stops by CMPD Division",
       caption = "Source: CMPD") +
  annotation_scale(location = "bl", width_hint = 0.2) +
  facet_wrap(~Year) +  
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = rel(1.5)),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank())

cmpd_chloropleth

ggsave(cmpd_chloropleth, filename = "cmpd_chloropleth.pdf",
       width = 7, height = 5, units = "in")
ggsave(cmpd_chloropleth, filename = "cmpd_chloropleth.png",
       width = 7, height = 5, units = "in")
```


## Choosing a ggplot extensions  (1 point)

Go to [ggextensions website](https://www.ggplot2-exts.org/). Then click Galleries to explore the different ggplot extensions. Scroll through and see if any catch your eye.

Now, select **one** of the ggextension libraries below and install the package (through CRAN):

- [`ggridges`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html) / [example to recreate](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html#varying-fill-colors-along-the-x-axis)^[Run both plots. Make sure to install the `viridis` package or else you'll get an error!]

- [`ggalt`](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/ggalt) / [example to recreate](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/ggalt#horzon-chart)^[Make sure to install `hrbrthemes`!]

- [`ggstatsplot`](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/ggstatsplot) / [example to recreate](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/ggstatsplot#ggscatterstats)^[Run all three examples in the `ggscatterstats` section.]

**Plot** the related example

```{r ggextension-examples}
library(ggrepel)
set.seed(42)

p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(y = wt, x = 1, label = rownames(mtcars))) +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  ylim(1, 5.5) +
  theme(
    axis.line.x  = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x  = element_blank(),
    axis.title.x = element_blank()
  )

p1 <- p +
  xlim(1, 1.375) +
  geom_text_repel(
    force        = 0.5,
    nudge_x      = 0.15,
    direction    = "y",
    hjust        = 0,
    segment.size = 0.2
  ) +
  ggtitle("hjust = 0")

p2 <- p + 
  xlim(1, 1.375) +
  geom_text_repel(
    force        = 0.5,
    nudge_x      = 0.2,
    direction    = "y",
    hjust        = 0.5,
    segment.size = 0.2
  ) +
  ggtitle("hjust = 0.5 (default)")

p3 <- p +
  xlim(0.25, 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(position = "right") +
  geom_text_repel(
    force        = 0.5,
    nudge_x      = -0.25,
    direction    = "y",
    hjust        = 1,
    segment.size = 0.2
  ) +
  ggtitle("hjust = 1")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 3)
```

Now, with the same package you ran, make a **plot** with that package and the gapminder data. You can choose any of the data frames (i.e., years). Make sure your plot has at least six functions (e.g., ggplot() + geom_point() is two functions and `dplyr` functions count as well.)

```{r ggextension-custom}
library(ggrepel)
library(gapminder)
library(ggplot2)
set.seed(42)

p <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(y = country, x = 1, label = rownames(gapminder))) +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  ylim(1, 5.5) +
  theme(
    axis.line.x  = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x  = element_blank(),
    axis.title.x = element_blank()
  )

p1 <- p +
  xlim(1, 1.375) +
  geom_text_repel(
    force        = 0.5,
    nudge_x      = 0.15,
    direction    = "y",
    hjust        = 0,
    segment.size = 0.2
  ) +
  ggtitle("hjust = 0")

p2 <- p + 
  xlim(1, 1.375) +
  geom_text_repel(
    force        = 0.5,
    nudge_x      = 0.2,
    direction    = "y",
    hjust        = 0.5,
    segment.size = 0.2
  ) +
  ggtitle("hjust = 0.5 (default)")

p3 <- p +
  xlim(0.25, 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(position = "right") +
  geom_text_repel(
    force        = 0.5,
    nudge_x      = -0.25,
    direction    = "y",
    hjust        = 1,
    segment.size = 0.2
  ) +
  ggtitle("hjust = 1")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 3)
```

Describe what you have found using that plot (write at least 3 sentences): The three things I have learned from using the ggrepel plot is that: 
  1. 
  2. 
  3. 
  

## Intro to interactivity (0.5 points)

For even more fun, **plot** an interactive HTML plot using the code for any of the plots above (fair warning, some of the ggextensions may not work well). 

The easiest way to do this is to use the `plotly` package (install it with the "Packages" panel in RStudio), and then to use its `ggplotly()` function.

I've given you some commented-out code below (commented out so that R doesn't yell at you about the code not working when you knit). 

Also, check out [the documentation](https://plot.ly/ggplot2/), especially [this page](https://plot.ly/ggplot2/interactive-tooltip/) about customizing the tooltips that show up when you hover over points or areas.

```{r interactive, message=FALSE}
install.packages("plotly")
library(plotly)
g <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Date, y = Reason_for_Stop, group = Driver_Ethnicity)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.4) 
ggplotly(g, tooltip = c("Driver_Ethnicity"))
```
